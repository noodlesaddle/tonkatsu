 Why have I started learning GO, even if I am a frontend engineer?
 When I started working as a frontend engineer, it was so overwhelming to learn all the technologies used in web development. Sometimes I would get lost in information overload.
 After one big sigh, I told myself "everybody started little and became an experts". So I started learning new things small by small.

 Lets see what we can know about Go.

# An Introduction to Go Programming Language for React Developers

As a React developer, you're probably familiar with JavaScript and its ecosystem of libraries and tools. While JavaScript is a great language for building client-side applications, it's not always the best choice for building server-side applications that need to handle a large volume of requests and data. This is where Go comes in.

Go is a powerful and efficient programming language that is designed to be fast and scalable, making it a great choice for building backend systems and microservices. Here are some of the key features of Go that make it a great choice for React developers:

## Performance

One of the main benefits of Go is its performance. Go is a compiled language, which means that it is optimized for speed and efficiency. This makes Go a great choice for building high-performance backend systems and APIs that need to handle a large volume of requests and data.

## Concurrency

Go is designed to support concurrency, which means that it can handle multiple tasks and requests at the same time. This makes it easy to build systems that can scale to handle a large number of users and requests. Go achieves concurrency through its support for goroutines and channels, which allow for easy and efficient communication between different parts of the program.

## Ease of Use

Go has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax, which makes it a great choice for developers who are new to the language. Go's syntax is similar to C, which should be familiar to most developers. In addition, Go has a growing community of developers and resources, which makes it easy to get started with the language.

## Cross-platform Support

Go is designed to be cross-platform, which means that it can run on a wide range of operating systems and platforms. This makes it easy to build applications that can run on multiple platforms, without the need for additional development or customization.

## Getting Started

To get started with Go, you'll need to download and install the Go compiler on your computer. You can download the latest version of the compiler from the official Go website (https://golang.org/). Once you've installed the compiler, you can start writing Go programs using your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Go:


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```


In this program, we import the "fmt" package to use the Println() function, which prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. We then define a main() function, which is the entry point for the program. When we run the program, the output will be "Hello, World!".

## Conclusion

As a React developer, Go is a great language to consider if you're looking to build backend systems and APIs that need to handle a large volume of requests and data. With its support for performance, concurrency, ease of use, and cross-platform support, Go is a powerful and efficient language that can help you build scalable and reliable systems.
