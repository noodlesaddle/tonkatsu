# I have decided to become a web developer in Japan. 

I came to Japan to study for my Master Degree at Nagoya University. This was right after the pandemic and Japan opened its border for brief period which gave me a window to come here. I was thrilled to start a new journey and life has turned to be even better for me and wife.
As I mentioned in my about section, I am a recent dad of a wonderful boy. Since I heard the news, I have decided to support my family by working here. Well, this is not an easy experience with little Japanese, and with travel tourism background.
I taught english to kindergarten kids and in the spare time started learning web development since I had UI UX designer skills. Well, after maybe 100 applications, I was able to join a system development team.
I am writing about things I have researched about on becoming frontend engineer in this post. You might find it silly or funny but this experience has taught me a lot about web development. I am still constantly learning about new technologies and tools to improve myself to be better developer.

 Here are some of the key essentials for frontend development engineers to learn:

1. HTML/CSS: HTML is the markup language used to structure content on the web, while CSS is used to style it. These are the building blocks of every website and application and are essential for any frontend development engineer to learn.

2. JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used to make websites interactive and dynamic. It's an essential skill for frontend developers as it enables them to create rich, engaging user experiences.

3. Frontend Frameworks: Frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue are essential tools for modern frontend development. They allow developers to create complex web applications more efficiently by providing pre-built components and a structure for organizing code.

4. Responsive Design: With the rise of mobile devices, responsive design has become essential for frontend developers. This means designing websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience across all platforms.

5. Web Performance: In today's fast-paced digital world, users expect websites and applications to load quickly. Frontend developers need to understand web performance optimization techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, and caching to ensure their applications are fast and responsive.

6. Version Control: Version control is essential for any software development project, including frontend development. It allows developers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and roll back changes if necessary. Git is the most popular version control system, and it's essential for frontend developers to learn.

7. Testing: Testing is an essential part of any software development project, and frontend development is no exception. Frontend developers should be familiar with testing frameworks such as Jest, Enzyme, and Cypress to ensure their applications are free of bugs and perform as expected.

8. Accessibility: Accessibility is an essential consideration for frontend developers. Websites and applications should be designed and developed with accessibility in mind, ensuring they are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

I hope this will help you as it helped me during my developer experience.
